# Make a pull request
Make sure you’re still in the Jetro directory, which is the top folder for Jetro’s clone of the Cats repo. You can use the command pwd to verify your folder location.
```bash
    pwd
```

Right now, there's nothing for Jetro to pull because you haven't made any changes since Jetro cloned the repo. You can prove that by using the following command, which shows the output `Already up-to-date`:
```bash
    git pull
```

# Make a change and submit a pull request.
Jetro starts working on the website. Jetro's first decision is to change the site's background color. Jetro experiments locally and ultimately chooses their favorite shade of light blue.

1. Set up an identity fot Jetro by running the following command:
```bash
    git config user.name "Jetro"
    git config user.email "jetro@code.com"
```
These `config` settings are stored in the repo in the *.git/config* file, so you won't have to enter them again. Each time you change to the Alice directory, you effectively assume Jetro's identity.

2. Open the *site.css* file in the Jetro/CSS directory:
```bash
    code CSS/site.css
```
3. To change the background color of the page to light blue, replace the second line in the file with the following statement:
```css
    body { font-family: serif; background-color: #F0FFF8; }
```
Then, save the file and close the editor.

4. Now, commit the change:
```bash
    git commit -a -m "Change background color to light blue"
```

5. Then, make a pull request back to the original repo:
```bash
    git request-pull -p origin/main .
```

6. Check the output. You should see output similar to the following example:
```output

# Create a remote and complete the pull request
Because your project directory and the Jetro directory are on the same computer, you can pull directly from the Jetro directory. In real life, the Jetro directory would be on Jetro's computer. You solve this situation by setting up a remote by using the `git remote` command. Then, you use that remote for pull and push requests. It's not practical to set up two machines to do these steps here, so we'll set up a remote that uses a local path name. In reality, you would use a network path or URL instead.

1. Change back to the project directory and use the `git remote` command to create a remote named `remote-alice` that targets Jetro's project directory:
```bash
    cd ../Cats
    git remote add remote-jetro ../Jetro
```

2. Now, execute a pull:
```bash
    git pull remote-alice main
```
Notice that you have to specify a branch, `main`, in the pull command.

3. Check the output. You should see output like this example, which shows that you successfully completed the pull request:
```output
    remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Total 4 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    From ../Alice

    * [new branch]      main     -> remote-alice/main
