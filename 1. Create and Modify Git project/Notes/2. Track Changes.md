# Make changes and track them with Git.
As you work on your project, Git helps keep track of the changes you make. It also lets you undo mistakes.

## Modify index.html
The website's home page, *index.html*, currently contains just one line of HTML. Let's update it to do more, and then commit the change to `Git`.

1. Reopen the *index.html* file in the online editor for Cloud Shell (`code index.html`) and replace the file contents with the following HTML:
```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset='UTF-8'>
        <title>Our Feline Friends</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Our Feline Friends</h1>
        <p>Eventually we will put cat pictures here.</p>
        <hr>
    </body>
    </html>
```

2. Save the file and close the online editor.

3. Use a `git diff` command to see what changed:
```bash
    git diff
```
The output format is the same as the Unix `diff` command, and the Git command has many of the same options. A plus sign appears in front of lines that were added, and a minus sign indicates lines that were deleted.

The default is for `git diff` to compare the working tree to the index. In other words, it shows you all the changes that haven't been staged (added to Git's index) yet. To compare the working tree to the last commit, you can use `git diff HEAD`.

If the command doesn't return to the prompt after it executes, enter `q` to exit the diff view.

4. Next, commit the change. Instead of using the `-a` flag, you can explicitly name a file to be staged and committed if Git already has the file in the index (the `commit` command looks only for the existence of a file).
```bash
    git commit -m "Add HTML boilerplate to index.html" index.html
```

5. Use `git diff` again to compare the working tree to the index:
```bash
    git diff
```
This time, `git diff` produces no output because the working tree, index, and `HEAD` are all in agreement.

6. Let's say you decide "furry" sounds friendlier than "feline." Replace the two occurrences of "Feline" in *index.html* with "Furry." Then, save the file.

7. Use the following command to create and open a file named *.gitignore* in the built-in code editor:
```bash
    code .gitignore
```

8. Add the following lines to the file:
```bash
    *.bak
    *~
```
This line instructs Git to ignore files that have file names ending in `.bak` or `~`.

9. Save and close the editor, and then use these commands to commit the changes:
```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Make small wording change; ignore editor backups"
```
This example uses the `-A` option with `git add` to add all untracked (and not ignored) files, and the files that have changed, to the files that are already under Git control.

If you do a `git diff` right now, the output will be empty because the changes have been committed. However, you can always use a `git diff HEAD^` command to compare differences between the latest commit and previous commit. Try it and see. Don't forget to include the caret `^` character at the end of the command.

## Add a subdirectory.
Most websites use HTML and CSS style sheets, and the site you're building is no exception. Style sheets typically are stored in a subdirectory, so let's create a subdirectory named CSS and add it to the repo.

1. Begin by creating a subdirectory named CSS in the project directory:
```bash
    mkdir CSS
```

2. Then, do a `git status`:
```bash
    git status
```
Why does Git report that there's nothing to commit?

People often are surprised to learn that Git doesn't consider adding an empty directory to be a change. That's because Git tracks only changes to files, not changes to directories.

Sometimes, especially in the initial stages of development, you want to have empty directories as placeholders. A common convention is to create an empty file, often called .git-keep, in a placeholder directory.

3. Use the following commands to create an empty file with that name in the CSS subdirectory and add the contents of the subdirectory to the index:
```bash
    touch CSS/.git-keep
    git add CSS
```

4. Follow up by using `git status` again to check the status of the repo. Confirm that it reports one new file.


## Replace a file.
Now, let's replace *.git-keep* with a CSS file and update *index.html* to reference it.

1. Delete *.git-keep* from the CSS subdirectory:
```bash
    rm CSS/.git-keep
```

2. Use the built-in editor to create a file named *site.css* in the CSS subdirectory:
```bash
    cd CSS
    code site.css
```

3. Add the following CSS to the file. Then, save and close the file.
```css
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { font-family: sans-serif; }
    body { font-family: serif; }
```

4. Now, add the following line to *index.html* (don't forget to go back up to the GitExample directory) after the `<title>` line, and save the modified file:
```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS/site.css">
```

5. Use `git status` to see a summary of the files that have changed. Then, use the following commands to stage untracked files to version control and commit your changes to *site.css* and *index.html*:
```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add a simple stylesheet"
```

## List commits.
Now that you have a reasonable number of changes recorded, you can use git log to look at them. As with most Git commands, there are plenty of options to choose from. One of the most useful is `--oneline`.

1. Use the following command to review all your commits:
```bash
    git log
```

2. Check the output. It should look similar to this example:
```output
    commit ae3f99c45db2547e59d8fcd8a6723e81bbc03b70
    Author: User Name <user-name@contoso.com>
    Date:   Fri Nov 15 22:04:05 2019 +0000

        Add a simple stylesheet

    commit 4d07803d7c706bb48c52fcf006ad50946a2a9503
    Author: User Name <user-name@contoso.com>
    Date:   Fri Nov 15 21:59:10 2019 +0000

        Make small wording change; ignore editor backups

    ...
```

3. Now, use this command to get a more concise listing:
```bash
    git log --oneline
```

4. Check the output again. This time, it should look like this example:
```output
    ae3f99c Add a simple stylesheet
    4d07803 Make small wording change; ignore editor backups
    f827c71 Add HTML boilerplate to index.html
    45535f0 Add a heading to index.html
    a69fe78 Create an empty index.html file
```

You can see why, when you're hundreds (or thousands) of commits into a project, the `--oneline` option might be your best friend. Another useful option is `-nX`, where `X` is a commit number: 1 for the latest commit, 2 for the one before that, and so on. To see for yourself, try a `git log -n2` command.
