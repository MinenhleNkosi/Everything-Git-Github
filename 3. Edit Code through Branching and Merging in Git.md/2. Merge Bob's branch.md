# Create a branch for Bob

1. Return to the *Bob* directory, and run the following command to create a branch named `add-cat`. Use the popular `checkout -b` option to create the branch and switch to it in a single command.

```shell
    cd ../Bob
    git checkout -b add-cat
```

2. Download the zip file that contains [some website resources](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-branch-merge-git/raw/main/git-resources.zip). Then, unzip the resource files:
```shell
    wget https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-branch-merge-git/raw/main/git-resources.zip
    unzip git-resources.zip
```

3. Now, move the *bobcat2-317x240.jpg* file into Bob's Assets directory. Delete the other files. You'll download the files and use them again later.
```bash
    mv bobcat2-317x240.jpg Assets/bobcat2-317x240.jpg
    rm git-resources.zip
    rm bombay-cat-180x240.jpg
```

4. Next, open the index.html file and replace the line that says "Eventually we will put cat pictures here" with the following line:
```html
    <img src="Assets/bobcat2-317x240.jpg" />
```

5. Save the file, and close the editor.

6. You've made two changes to Bob's `add-cat` branch â€” you added one file and modified another. Run `git status` to double-check your changes:
```bash
    git status
```

7. Then, run the following commands to add the new file in the Assets directory to the index and commit all changes:
```bash
    git add .
    git commit -a -m "Add picture of Bob's cat"
```

8. Bob now does the same action that Jetro did earlier. Bob switches back to the main branch, and executes a pull to see if anything has changed:
```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull
```

9. Check the output. This time, the output indicates that changes *have* been made to the `main` branch in the shared repo (the result of Jetro's push). It also indicates that the changes pulled from `main` in the shared repo have been merged with `main` in Bob's repo:
```output
    remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Total 4 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    From D:/Labs/Git/Bob/../Shared
    e81ae09..1d2bfea  main     -> origin/main
    Updating e81ae09..1d2bfea
    Fast-forward
    Assets/site.css | 3 ++-
    1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 ```

10. Next, Bob merges their branch into the `main` branch so that `main` in their repo will have their changes *and* Jetro's changes. Then, Bob pushes `main` on their computer to the `main` branch in the shared repo:
```bash
    git merge add-cat --no-edit
    git push
```

Bob didn't use the `--ff-only` flag because they knew that `main` had changed. A fast-forward only merge would have failed.

# Sync the repos
At this point, Bob has an up-to-date repo, but Jetro doesn't. Jetro needs to do a `git pull` from the shared repo to make sure they have the latest and greatest version of the site.

Run the following commands to sync Jetro's repo with the shared repo:
```bash
    cd ../Jetro
    git pull
```

Take a moment to verify that Jetro's repo and Bob's repo are synced. Each of the repos should have a JPG file in the Assets directory, and an `<img>` element declared in the `index.html` file. The site.css file in each repo's Assets folder should contain a line that defines a CSS style named cat. This style was added by Jetro when they made their changes.

If you open `index.html` in a browser, you'll see Screenshot that shows cats on the website.
