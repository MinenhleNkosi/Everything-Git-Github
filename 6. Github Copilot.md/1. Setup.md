# Set up, configure, and troubleshoot GitHub Copilot
In this unit, we discuss how to sign up for GitHub Copilot, how to configure GitHub Copilot using Visual Studio Code, and some steps to troubleshoot GitHub Copilot using Visual Studio Code.

## Sign up for GitHub Copilot
Before you can start using GitHub Copilot, you need to set up a free trial or subscription for your personal account.

You can do so by selecting your profile photo and then selecting Settings. Copilot is on the left-hand menu under Code, planning, and automation.

After you sign up, you'll need to install an extension for your preferred environment. GitHub Copilot supports GitHub.com, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim as an unobtrusive extension.

For this specific module, we'll just be reviewing extensions and configurations for Visual Studio Code, because the exercise we'll complete in this module uses Visual Studio Code.

If you're using a different environment, you can find specific links to set up those environments in the References section at the end of this module.

3. Under Inline Suggest: Enable, select or deselect the checkbox to enable or disable inline suggestions.

Additionally, you can choose to enable or disable inline suggestions and specify for which languages you want to enable or disable GitHub Copilot.

## Troubleshoot GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code
In Visual Studio Code, the log files are useful for diagnosing connection issues. The GitHub Copilot extension stores the log files in the standard log location for Visual Studio Code extensions. You can find the log files through the developer option and open extension logs folder within Visual Studio Code.

In rare cases, errors might not be logged in the regular locations. If you encounter errors and there's nothing in the logs, you might try to see the logs from the process running Visual Studio Code and the extension. This process allows you to view the Electron logs. You can find these logs under developer and in **Help** > **Toggle Developer Tools** within Visual Studio Code.

Network restrictions, firewalls, or your proxy may cause issues when connecting to GitHub Copilot. If this occurs, you can follow these next steps to open a new editor with the relevant information that you can inspect yourself or share with the support team.

1. Open the Visual Studio Code Command Palette:
* For Mac, use **Shift+Command+P**
* For Windows or Linux, use **Ctrl+Shift+P**

2. Type **Diagnostics**, then select **GitHub Copilot: Collect Diagnostics** from the list.
