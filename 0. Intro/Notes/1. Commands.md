# Set up your Git repository.
Git works by checking for changes to files within a certain folder. I will create a folder (for demonstration) that Git will use to track changes amde in it and sync them.

Start by creating an empty folder for your project, and then initialize a Git repository inside it.

1. Create a folder named GitExammple. This folder will be the project **directory**, also called the **working tree**. The project directory is where all files related to your project are stored.

```bash
    mkdir GitExample
```

2. Change to the project directory by using the `cd` command:
```bash
    cd GitExample
```

3. Now, initialize your new repository and set the name of the default branch to `main`:
```bash
    git init --initial-branch=main
```

After you run the initialize command, you should see output that's similar to this example:
```bash
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/<user>/Cats/.git/

    Switched to a new branch 'main'
```

4. Now, use a `git status` command to show the status of the working tree:
```bash
    git status
```

Git responds with this output, which indicates that `master` is the current branch. (It's also the only branch.) So far, so good:
```bash
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

5. Use an ls command to show the contents of the working tree:
```bash
    ls -a
```


# Get help from Git
Type the following command to get help with what you can do with Git:
