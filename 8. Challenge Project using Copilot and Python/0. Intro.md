# Introduction
Creating a minigame can help you practice your programming skills and improve your ability to create console applications in Python.

In this module, you develop the classic rock, paper, scissors minigame, with the help of GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot. That is, you don't need to worry about configuring the development environment, so you can focus on application development while relying on a code assistant.

## About the challenge
The rock, paper, scissors game is a hand game in which each player chooses one of the three tools. From a programming point of view, this challenge is a nice exercise to practice conditional decisions, iterations, and the use of Python modules.

The winner of the game is based in three simple rules:
* Rock beats scissors.
* Scissors beat paper.
* Paper beats rock.

By the end of this module, you have a playable mini-game application with GitHub Copilot!

```
    This is a **challenge project** module where you will complete a project end-to-end based on a specification. This module is designed to be a test of your skills: there are few guidelines and no step-by-step instructions.

## Learning objectives
In this module, you demonstrate your ability to:
* Use GitHub Codespaces as a development environment.
* Use GitHub Copilot as an assistant.
* Develop input and output routines in a Python console application.

## Prerequisites
* A GitHub account and basic knowledge of Git commands to execute the routines (add, commit and push).
* Basic of Python to work with variables, lists, loops, conditionals and print messages on the console.
* GitHub Copilot enabled in your GitHub account.
* Basic understanding of how to install extensions in Visual Studio Code.
